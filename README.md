# Timora ⌚- E-commerce Website for Watches

![1752006411950](image/README/1752006411950.png)

**Timora** is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform offers a seamless shopping experience for watch enthusiasts, featuring a dynamic and responsive user interface, secure user authentication, product filtering, and a robust payment system. The application is designed to provide both users and administrators with intuitive dashboards to manage products, categories, and orders efficiently.

This project was developed as part of a comprehensive MERN stack tutorial, guiding developers through the process of building a scalable e-commerce platform from scratch. The application is deployed on **Render** and integrates **Razorpay** for secure payment processing.
